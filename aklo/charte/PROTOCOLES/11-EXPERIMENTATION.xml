  <section title="Experimentation Procedure">
    <step number="1" type="analysis" title="Planning and Hypothesis Definition">
      <action>Create a new `EXPERIMENT-[ID]-PLANNING.xml` file. Fill in the "Hypothesis and Metrics" and "Variants Description" sections. Draft an initial "Technical Implementation Plan".</action>
      <automation optional="true">`aklo experiment "[Experiment Title]"`</automation>
      <awaiting_validation>Submit this plan to the Human_Developer for validation to ensure the hypothesis is solid and measurable.</awaiting_validation>
    </step>
    <step number="2" type="procedure" title="Implementation">
      <action>Once the plan is validated, change the status to `AWAITING_IMPLEMENTATION`. Activate the [PLANIFICATION] protocol to create the necessary technical Tasks. Once the Tasks are implemented and the code is deployed, activate the feature flag to start the experiment.</action>
    </step>
    <step number="3" type="procedure" title="Execution and Monitoring">
      <action>Change the status to `RUNNING`. Monitor the metrics to ensure the experiment is running as expected and has no unexpected negative impacts.</action>
    </step>
    <step number="4" type="analysis" title="Analysis and Conclusion">
      <action>Once the experiment's duration has elapsed (or statistical significance is reached), deactivate the experiment. Change the status to `COMPLETED`. Analyze the collected data and fill in the "Results and Decision" section.</action>
      <awaiting_validation>Submit the final analysis and the proposed decision to the Human_Developer.</awaiting_validation>
    </step>
    <step number="5" type="conclusion" title="Closure">
      <action>Once the decision is validated, change the status to `CONCLUDED`. Activate the [KNOWLEDGE-BASE] protocol to determine if the analysis has produced knowledge worth centralizing. If necessary, create the follow-up PBI to roll out the winning variant or clean up the experiment's code.</action>
    </step>
